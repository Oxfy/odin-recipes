        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grather all your ingredients</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in dutch oven over
                medium heat until well browned.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basic, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
                seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2
                hours, stirring occasionally. 
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles
                in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rince with cold water.
            </li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
                tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees C (375 degrees F)</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of 9x13-inch
                baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the
                mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
                and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with
                cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake 
                for an additional 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Rest Lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
